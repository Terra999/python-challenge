U of M Boot Camp Assignment Python Homework - Py Me Up, Charlie

This repo includes 2 assignments: PyBank and PyPoll.

For the PyBank assignment we were asked to create a Python script to analyze the financial records of a bank. The analysis included the following:

> The total number of months included in the dataset
> The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
> Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
> The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
> The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

For the PyPoll assignment we were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. This included creating a Python script to analyze the votes and to calculate each of the following:

> The total number of votes cast
> A complete list of candidates who received votes
> The percentage of votes each candidate won
> The total number of votes each candidate won
> The winner of the election based on popular vote.
